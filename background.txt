Addresses 4 Aspects:
1. Confidentiality
  - information transmitted between senders and receivers should be accessible only to the corresponding parties
2. Authetnication
  - determining that the information you're getting is from the source it claims to come from
3. Integrity
  - infomraitn you have accessed must be original, intact and complete
4. Availability
  - information you are authorized to access is always accessible


WHAT IS ENCRYPTION?
  - cipher encyrption; letters in the text are shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet to make them unreadable 

PRIVATE KEY ENCRYPTION (SYMMETRIC KEY)
  - sender and receiver use same key to encrypt the message and to decrypt the message 
  - because both parties use the same key, its also called symmetric key encryption 
  - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    - most popular private key encryption 
PUBLIC KEY ENCRPYTION (ASYMMETRIC KEY)
  - sender and reciever use different keys to encrpty message and decrypt message 

HASH FUNCTION
- turns a large, long text message into a short, fixed-length message called a message digest 
= when the long tet message changes, the short message digest will also change
